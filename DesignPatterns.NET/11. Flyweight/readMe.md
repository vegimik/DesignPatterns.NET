	=> dotMemory Unit is an additional unit testing framework that allows you to write tests that check code for all kinds of memory issues. For example, these can be tests that determine leaks by checking memory for objects of a particular type, or tests that track memory traffic and fail in case the traffic exceeds some threshold. In other words, dotMemory Unit extends your unit testing framework (NUnit, MSTest, or other) with the functionality of a memory profiler.
